# Treasure Dive

![Game Preview](/public/img/game-preview.webp)

The objective is to collect as many treasure chests from the bottom of the lake and bring it back to the boat within the time limit. Fish obstacles are scattered everywhere, and colliding into a fish will halt the players actions and also drop the treasure chest if one was in possession. The goal is to avoid any obstacle while bringing the treasure chest back safely.
